					<h3>2.7</h3>

					<p>If you are using our trials or if you sign-up for our subscriptions or purchase something via the service, credit card information and other finance related information that are necessary for payment processing will be collected and saved by a payment service provider. We also collect certain limited information, e.g. your postal code, cell phone number and details of your transaction history. Other than that, the payment service providers usually provide us only with very limited information regarding you, e.g. the specific token that enables you to perform further purchases using the data saved by the provider as well as your type of card, expiration date und the last four digits of the number.</p>

					<h2>3. Social Plugins</h2>

					<h3>3.1</h3>

					<p>Mimo offers you the opportunity to recommend offers, services and/or products via Facebook. Mimo uses Facebook’s social plugins for this purpose. These services are offered by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (Facebook). The list and the look of the Facebook social plugins can be viewed here and you can find other general information about the social plugins here.</p>
					<br>
					<p>When loading the internet site in your browser, the code of the social plugin will be directly requested by a Facebook server through your browser and integrated into the appearing Mimo internet site in your browser. Mimo has thus no influence on the scope of retrieved data by Facebook in this relation.</p>
					<br>
					<p>According to Facebook's own information, Facebook saves date and time of your visit, the precise Internet address in which the social plugin is located and other technical data, e.g. IP address, browser type, operating system for a period of 90 days in order to optimize Facebook’s services. After expiry of the 90 days, the data will be anonymized so that they cannot be related to you any longer. You can find more information from Facebook here.</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you are logged in on Facebook during a visit on a website of Mimo, Facebook can associate the pages you visited to your Facebook account. Through the interaction with the social plugins (clicking etc.) the information evoked by the interaction will be transferred to and saved by Facebook. You can prevent this by logging-off Facebook prior to visiting our website.</p>
					<p>It is also possible to generally block Facebook plugins. There are extensions for respective browsers for this purpose (e.g. the Facebook Blocker) which you have to install and activate on your respective browser. Facebook data protection notifications as well as further setting options for protecting your privacy are available here.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Please also inform yourself regarding Facebook under all provided links as Facebook’s data protection policies are frequently updated and amended due to the extended functionality of social plugins.</p>

					<h3>3.2</h3>

					<p>Mimo offers you the opportunity to post offers, services and/or products and/or events etc. via Twitter. For this purpose, we use the service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107 and an accordingly configured plugin.</p>
					<p>The Tweet-Button enables you to share our contents via Twitter. The button shows the amount of Tweets regarding a shared content.</p>
					<br>
					<p>When loading the website in your browser, the code of the Tweet-Button will be directly requested by a Twitter Inc. server and integrated into the website appearing in your browser. We have thus no influence on the scope of data retrieved by Twitter Inc.</p>
					<p>According to Twitter’s own information, Twitter Inc. saves the sent Tweet message and its metadata. This includes the following according to our estimation: Date and time of the Tweet, precise and/or shortened internet address on which the Tweet-Button is located and further technical data, e.g. IP address, browser type or your operation system. Twitter Inc. does not share the information of how long information is saved for. You can find further information of Twitter Inc. here.</p>
